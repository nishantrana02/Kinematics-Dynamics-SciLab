# Lab 2: Coordinate Transformations in Scilab

This lab focuses on determining new coordinates of points after rotations along different axes.

## **Problem 1: Rotation of Point P by 30° and 54°**
### **Formula:**
$$
C = R_2 \times R_1 \times P
$$

### **Description:**  
Find the coordinates of point **P = [1,2,0]** after rotation by **30° (R1)** and **54° (R2)**.

---

## **Problem 2: Rotation of Multiple Points**
### **Formula:**
$$
C = R_3 \times R_2 \times R_1 \times P
$$

### **Description:**  
Find the new coordinates of the given points **P1, P2, P3, P4** after rotations by **θ₁ = 30°, θ₂ = 69°, θ₃ = 19°**.

---

## **Problem 3: Additional Rotation (θ₄ = 108°)**
### **Formula:**
$$
C = R_4 \times R_3 \times R_2 \times R_1 \times P
$$

### **Description:**  
Extend Problem 2 by adding another rotation **θ₄ = 108°** and compute the new coordinates.

---

## **Problem 4: Further Rotation (θ₅ = 11°)**
### **Formula:**
$$
C = R_5 \times R_4 \times R_3 \times R_2 \times R_1 \times P
$$

### **Description:**  
Extend Problem 3 by adding another rotation **θ₅ = 11°** and compute the new coordinates.

---

## **Problem 5: Additional Rotation (θ₆ = 7°)**
### **Formula:**
$$
C = R_6 \times R_5 \times R_4 \times R_3 \times R_2 \times R_1 \times P
$$

### **Description:**  
Extend Problem 4 by adding another rotation **θ₆ = 7°** and compute the new coordinates.

## **Problem 6: Plot Graph for Equal Intervals of X**
### **Description:**  
Plot a graph for **X values at equal intervals** from 0 to 30.

---

## **Problem 7: Plot Graph of Rotation along Z-Axis**
### **Description:**  
Plot the graph of the **rotation matrix along the Z-axis** by **θ₁ and θ₂**, varying from **1° to 30°** with **1° intervals**.

---

## **Problem 8: Plot Graph of Rotation with Time (0 to 3 seconds)**
### **Description:**  
Plot the graph of the **rotation matrix along the Z-axis** by **θ₁ and θ₂** within **1° to 30°**, with **time varying from 0 to 3 seconds**.
